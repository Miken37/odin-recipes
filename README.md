First project for Odin Project after learning GIT and HTML basics. 
First I made the index boiler plate then included an anchor link to another html page within the recipes directory.
Within this I created a pulledpork html file utilizing an image, headers, ordered and unordered lists as well a description paragraph.
After that I created two more html pages for pizza and burrito and added a back button from each recipe to take you back to the index.
I then copied the layout of pulled pork and changed everything to fit pizza and burrito.
